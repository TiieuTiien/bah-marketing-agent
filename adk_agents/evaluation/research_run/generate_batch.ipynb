       "  'description': 'First published in 1953 when James Baldwin was nearly 30, Go Tell It on the Mountainis a young man\\'s novel, as tightly coiled as a new spring, yet tempered by a maturing man\\'s confidence and empathy. It\\'s not a long book, and its action spans but a single day--yet the author packs in enough emotion, detail, and intimate revelation to make his story feel like a mid-20th-century epic. Using as a frame the spiritual and moral awakening of 14-year-old John Grimes during a Saturday night service in a Harlem storefront church, Baldwin lays bare the secrets of a tormented black family during the depression. John\\'s parents, praying beside him, both wrestle with the ghosts of their sinful pasts--Gabriel, a preacher of towering hypocrisy, fathered an illegitimate child during his first marriage down South and refused to recognize his doomed bastard son; Elizabeth fell in love with a charming, free-spirited young man, followed him to New York, became pregnant with his son, and lost him before she could reveal her condition. Baldwin lays down the terrible symmetries of these two blighted lives as the ironic context for John\\'s dark night of the soul. When day dawns, John believes himself saved, but his creator makes it clear that this salvation arises as much from blindness as revelation: \"He was filled with a joy, a joy unspeakable, whose roots, though he would not trace them on this new day of his life, were nourished by the wellspring of a despair not yet discovered.\" \\nThough it was hailed at publication for its groundbreaking use of black idiom, what is most striking about Go Tell It on the Mountaintoday is its structure and its scope. In peeling back the layers of these damaged lives, Baldwin dramatizes the story of the great black migration from rural South to urban North. \"Behind them was the darkness,\" Baldwin writes of Gabriel and Elizabeth\\'s lost generation, \"nothing but the darkness, and all around them destruction, and before them nothing but the fire--a bastard people, far from God, singing and crying in the wilderness!\" This is Baldwin\\'s music--a music in which rhapsody is rooted anguish--and there is none finer in American literature. --David Laskin'},\n",

       "  'description': \"Since its release nearly ten years ago, The Big Lebowskihas become a cult classic with a worldwide following, having survived the baffled reaction of many mainstream critics. Its fans tend to be fanatical, congregating at 'Lebowski Conventions' in bowling alleys across American and Britain, and even dressing up as characters from the film. Among the funniest films of the last twenty-five years, and one of the high-water marks of 1990s genre recycling and pastiche, The Big Lebowskiis also littered with playful and subversive references to film history, especially to Raymond Chandler's world of hardboiled detective classics and the world of film noir. The Big Lebowskiis the rarest kind of film, a comedy whose jokes become funnier with repetition. The same goes for its multitudinous jukebox-like references to other films, many of which open up vistas for intertextual interpretation. Underneath the film's breakneck pacing and foul-mouthed characters, a farcical collection of flakes, losers, and phonies, is a surprisingly humane account of what fools we mortals be. It is one of the oddest buddy films ever made, with extraordinary performances by Jeff Bridges and John Goodman. In this study, The Big Lebowskiis set into the context of 1990s Hollywood cinema, anatomised for its witty relationship with the classics which it satirises, and discussed in terms of its key theme: the hopeless flailing of ridiculously unmanly men in the world of discombobulated, mixed-up, or put-on identities that is Los Angeles.\"},\n",

Peter Pan or, The Boy Who Would Not Grow Up was first performed in 1904 and published 24 years later; his only play intended explicitly for a young audience. Barrie's success as a playwright allowed him to indulge in a level of philanthropy and the royalties earned from the much adored Peter Pan have helped fund the Great Ormond Street Hospital since his death. About the Illustrator: Mabel Lucie Attwell (1879-1964) was a household name during the 1930s and 40s working mostly in watercolour and pen-and-ink.

She was wearing a smart navy blue skirt suit, and brushing her long, brown hair out of her deep blue eyes. A youthful 28--she appeared to be about 21--she looked over at the light blue Jetta a few feet away on the driveway beside her. Inside the little VW sat three sexy feminine creatures. One of them, Mitch Kemp, was actually a man.\\nJulie giggled noting that he looked like the typical Tata Girl, and that \"she\" seemed to be in total shock. The other two lovely girls smiled back at Julie, but Mitch, alone in the back seat, stared vacantly into the middle distance. That was hardly a surprise as he\\'d been forcibly feminized earlier that morning.\\n\"I wonder what Mitch is thinking,\" Julie pondered, \"the little thong he\\'s wearing has to feel weird underneath his tight little uniform. And that push up bra squeezing his new C cup boobs can\\'t be too comfortable. At least his thong matches his pink jogging suit,\" she laughed, recalling every detail of Mitch\\'s humiliating transformation.\\nAs a private eye, it was Julie\\'s job to notice everything, and she\\'d noticed some very interesting things about Mitch. She reviewed her findings as she waved at Candy Jeffries and Lena Thomas, the two Tata Girls who\\'d done Mitch\\'s hair and makeup, and dressed him as a sexy girl. Julie blew a kiss at Mitch and slowly pulled out of the driveway.\\nSuddenly, Julie heard a commotion behind her. Candy was honking the horn, and Mitch was squeezing out the car window. Julie slammed on the breaks as Mitch hit the driveway and started to run. He didn\\'t get out of his front yard before Julie tackled him. She held him as Candy and Lena joined them.\\nJulie slapped Mitch across the face, just hard enough to startle, but not hard enough to smear his makeup. \"Listen you stupid bimbo,\" she said, \"you will be a perfect little Tata Girl, and you will do everything we say, or else!\"\\nLena and Candy put their hands over their mouths to stifle their shocked giggles while Julie showed Mitch dozens of pictures of his transformation on her phone....\\n\"Now are you going to be a good girl?\" Julie asked.\\nMitch nodded slightly, but Julie wasn\\'t satisfied. \"We need you to say it, girl,\" she demanded, taking an aggressive stance with her arms folded tightly.\\n\"Yes,\" Mitch said.\\n\"Yes what?\" she prompted.\\n\"Yes, I\\'ll be a good...a good g-girl,\" Mitch stuttered.\\n\"And what\\'s your name?\" Julie asked.\\n\"Mmmkay...\" Mitch mumbled.\\n\"What was that?\" Julie asked.\\n\"Mikayla, my name is Mikayla,\" Mitch said, almost gasping.\\n----\\nRead about the emasculation and feminization of a sexist as beautiful sexy waitresses turn him into one of them.

       "  'description': '\"What to eat, what not to eat, and how to think about health: a manifesto for our times \\'Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.\" These simple words go to the heart of Michael Pollan\\'s In Defense of Food, the well-considered answers he provides to the questions posed in the bestselling The Omnivore\\'s Dilemma. Humans used to know how to eat well, Pollan argues. But the balanced dietary lessons that were once passed down through generations have been confused, complicated, and distorted by food industry marketers, nutritional scientists, and journalists--all of whom have much to gain from our dietary confusion. As a result, we face today a complex culinary landscape dense with bad advice and foods that are not \"real.\" These \"edible foodlike substances\" are often packaged with labels bearing health claims that are typically false or misleading. Indeed, real food is fast disappearing from the marketplace, to be replaced by \"nutrients,\" and plain old eating by an obsession with nutrition that is, paradoxically, ruining our health, not to mention our meals. Michael Pollan\\'s sensible and decidedly counterintuitive advice is: \"Don\\'t eat anything that your great-great grandmother would not recognize as food.\" Writing In Defense of Food, and affirming the joy of eating, Pollan suggests that if we would pay more for better, well-grown food, but buy less of it, we\\'ll benefit ourselves, our communities, and the environment at large. Taking a clear-eyed look at what science does and does not know about the links between diet and health, he proposes a new way to think about the question of what to eat that is informed by ecology and tradition rather than by the prevailing nutrient-by-nutrient approach. In Defense of Foodreminds us that, despite the daunting dietary landscape Americans confront in the modern supermarket, the solutions to the current omnivore\\'s dilemma can be found all around us. In looking toward traditional diets the world over, as well as the foods our families--and regions--historically enjoyed, we can recover a more balanced, reasonable, and pleasurable approach to food.

       "  'description': 'Fire, water, air, earth--our most trusted food expert recounts the story of his culinary education\\nIn Cooked, Michael Pollan explores the previously uncharted territory of his own kitchen. Here, he discovers the enduring power of the four classical elements--fire, water, air, and earth--to transform the stuff of nature into delicious things to eat and drink. Apprenticing himself to a succession of culinary masters, Pollan learns how to grill with fire, cook with liquid, bake bread, and ferment everything from cheese to beer. In the course of his journey, he discovers that the cook occupies a special place in the world, standing squarely between nature and culture. Both realms are transformed by cooking, and so, in the process, is the cook.\\nEach section of Cookedtracks Pollan\\'s effort to master a single classic recipe using one of the four elements. A North Carolina barbecue pit master tutors him in the primal magic of fire; a Chez Panisse-trained cook schools him in the art of braising; a celebrated baker teaches him how air transforms grain and water into a fragrant loaf of bread; and finally, several mad-genius \"fermentos\" (a tribe that includes brewers, cheese makers, and all kinds of picklers) reveal how fungi and bacteria can perform the most amazing alchemies of all. The reader learns alongside Pollan, but the lessons move beyond the practical to become an investigation of how cooking involves us in a web of social and ecological relationships: with plants and animals, the soil, farmers, our history and culture, and, of course, the people our cooking nourishes and delights. Cooking, above all, connects us.\\nThe effects of not cooking are similarly far reaching. Relying upon corporations to process our food means we consume huge quantities of fat, sugar, and salt; disrupt an essential link to the natural world; and weaken our relationships with family and friends. In fact, Cookedargues, taking back control of cooking may be the single most important step anyone can take to help make the American food system healthier and more sustainable. Reclaiming cooking as an act of enjoyment and self-reliance, learning to perform the magic of these everyday transformations, opens the door to a more nourishing life.'},\n",

He was the golf coach at the University of Texas from 1931 to 1963, coaching the Longhorns to 21 Southwest Conference titles in 33 years, including 20 out of 23 seasons from 1932 to 1954.

In the post-tournament interview, Crenshaw said: \"I had a 15th club in my bag,\" a reference to Penick.

But it's hardly surprising considering how long it's had to hone its skills. Forty-thousand years ago, our ancestors set off from the cradle of civilization on their journey towards populating the planet. Tuberculosis hitched a lift and came with us, and it's been there ever since; waiting, watching, and learning.\\nThe organism responsible, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, has had plenty of time to adapt to its chosen habitat--human lungs--and has learned through natural selection to be an almost perfect pathogen. Using our own immune cells as a Trojan Horse to aid its spread, it's come up with clever ways to avoid being killed by antibiotics. But patience has been its biggest lesson--it can enter into a latent state when times are tough, only to come back to life when a host's immune system is compromised. Today, more than one million people die of the disease every year and around one-third of the world's population are believed to be infected. That's more than two billion people. Throw in the compounding problems of drug resistance, the HIV epidemic, and poverty, and it's clear that tuberculosis remains one of the most serious problems in world medicine.\\nCatching Breathfollows the history of TB through the ages, from its time as an infection of hunter-gatherers to the first human villages, which set it up with everything it needed to become the monstrous disease it is today, through to the perils of industrialization and urbanization. It goes on to look at the latest research in fighting the disease, with stories of modern scientific research, interviews with doctors on the TB frontline, and the personal experiences of those affected by the disease.\"},\n",

Shankar, the newest recruit, recounts the stories of several people whose lives come together in the suites, restaurants, bar and backrooms of the hotel. As both observer and participant in the events, he inadvertently peels off the layers of everyday existence to expose the seamy underbelly of unfulfilled desires, broken dreams, callous manipulation and unbidden tragedy. What unfolds is not just the story of individual lives but also the incredible chronicle of a metropolis. Written by best-selling Bengali author Sankar, Chowringhee was published as a novel in 1962. Predating Arthur Hailey's Hotel by three years, it became an instant hit, spawning translations in major Indian languages, a film and a play. Its larger-than-life characters--the enigmatic manager Marco Polo, the debonair receptionist Sata Bose, the tragic hostess Karabi Guha, among others--soon attained cult status. With its thinly veiled accounts of the private lives of real-life celebrities, and its sympathetic narrative seamlessly weaving the past and the present, it immediately established itself as a popular classic.

Slavoj Zizek has identified the four horsemen of this coming apocalypse: the worldwide ecological crisis; imbalances within the economic system; the biogenetic revolution; and exploding social divisions and ruptures. But, he asks, if the end of capitalism seems to many like the end of the world, how is it possible for Western society to face up to the end times? In a major new analysis of our global situation, Slavoj Zizek argues that our collective responses to economic Armageddon correspond to the stages of grief: ideological denial, explosions of anger and attempts at bargaining, followed by depression and withdrawal. For this edition, Zizek has written a long afterword that leaves almost no subject untouched, from WikiLeaks to the nature of the Chinese Communist Party.'},\n",

The child of two lawyers, she is staunchly anti-death penalty. But the moment convicted murderer Ricky Langley's face flashes on the screen as she reviews old tapes--the moment she hears him speak of his crimes--she is overcome with the feeling of wanting him to die. Shocked by her reaction, she digs deeper and deeper into the case. Despite their vastly different circumstances, something in his story is unsettlingly, uncannily familiar.\\nCrime, even the darkest and most unsayable acts, can happen to any one of us. As Alexandria pores over the facts of the murder, she finds herself thrust into the complicated narrative of Ricky's childhood. And by examining the details of Ricky's case, she is forced to face her own story, to unearth long-buried family secrets, and reckon with a past that colors her view of Ricky's crime.\\nBut another surprise awaits: She wasn't the only one who saw her life in Ricky's.\\nAn intellectual and emotional thriller that is also a different kind of murder mystery, THE FACT OF A BODY is a book not only about how the story of one crime was constructed--but about how we grapple with our own personal histories. Along the way it tackles questions about the nature of forgiveness, and if a single narrative can ever really contain something as definitive as the truth. This groundbreaking, heart-stopping work, ten years in the making, shows how the law is more personal than we would like to believe--and the truth more complicated, and powerful, than we could ever imagine.\"},\n",

But no one knows about the early life of the Son of God, the missing years -- except Biff. Ever since the day when he came upon six-year-old Joshua of Nazareth resurrecting lizards in the village square, Levi bar Alphaeus, called \"Biff,\"had the distinction of being the Messiah\\'s best bud. That\\'s why the angel Raziel has resurrected Biff from the dust of Jerusalem and brought him to America to write a new gospel, one that tells the real, untold story. Meanwhile, Raziel will order pizza, watch the WWF on TV, and aspire to become Spider-Man.Verily, the story Biff has to tell is a miraculous one, filled with remarkable journeys, magic, healings, kung-fu, corpse reanimations, demons, and hot babes -- whose considerable charms fall to Biff to sample, since Josh is forbidden the pleasures of the flesh. (There are worse things than having a best friend who is chaste \"and\" a chick magnet!) And, of course, there is danger at every turn, since a young man struggling to understand his godhood, who is incapable of violence or telling anything less than the truth, is certain to piss some people off. Luckily Biff is a whiz at lying and cheating -- which helps get his divine pal and him out of more than one jam. And while Josh\\'s great deeds and mission of peace will ultimately change the world, Biff is no slouch himself, blessing humanity with enduring contributions of his own, like sarcasm and cafe latte. Even the considerable wiles and devotion of the Savior\\'s pal may not be enough to divert Joshua from his tragic destiny. But there\\'s no one who loves Josh more --except maybe \"Maggie,\" Mary of Magdala -- and Biff isn\\'t about to let his extraordinary pal suffer and ascend without a fight.\"Lamb\" is the crowning achievement of Christopher Moore\\'s storied career: fresh, wild, audacious, divinely hilarious, yet heartfelt, poignant, and alive, with a surprising reverence.

       "  'description': \"Before Alexandria Marzano-Lesnevich begins a summer job at a law firm in Louisiana, working to help defend men accused of murder, she thinks her position is clear. The child of two lawyers, she is staunchly anti-death penalty. But the moment convicted murderer Ricky Langley's face flashes on the screen as she reviews old tapes--the moment she hears him speak of his crimes--she is overcome with the feeling of wanting him to die. Shocked by her reaction, she digs deeper and deeper into the case. Despite their vastly different circumstances, something in his story is unsettlingly, uncannily familiar.\\nCrime, even the darkest and most unsayable acts, can happen to any one of us. As Alexandria pores over the facts of the murder, she finds herself thrust into the complicated narrative of Ricky's childhood. And by examining the details of Ricky's case, she is forced to face her own story, to unearth long-buried family secrets, and reckon with a past that colors her view of Ricky's crime.\\nBut another surprise awaits: She wasn't the only one who saw her life in Ricky's.\\nAn intellectual and emotional thriller that is also a different kind of murder mystery, THE FACT OF A BODY is a book not only about how the story of one crime was constructed--but about how we grapple with our own personal histories. Along the way it tackles questions about the nature of forgiveness, and if a single narrative can ever really contain something as definitive as the truth. This groundbreaking, heart-stopping work, ten years in the making, shows how the law is more personal than we would like to believe--and the truth more complicated, and powerful, than we could ever imagine.\"},\n",

Based in part on previously classified documents, Patricia Posner exposes Capesius's reign of terror at the camp, his escape from justice, fueled in part by his theft of gold ripped from the mouths of corpses, and how a handful of courageous survivors and a single brave prosecutor finally brought him to trial for murder twenty years after the end of the war.\\nThe Pharmacist of Auschwitzis much more, though, than a personal account of Capesius. It provides a spellbinding glimpse inside the devil's pact made between the Nazis and Germany's largest conglomerate, I.G. Farben, and its Bayer pharmaceutical subsidiary. The story is one of murder and greed with its roots in the dark heart of the Holocaust. It is told through Nazi henchmen and industrialists turned war criminals, intelligence agents and zealous prosecutors, and intrepid concentration camp survivors and Nazi hunters.\\nSet against a backdrop ranging from Hitler's war to conquer Europe to the Final Solution to postwar Germany's tormented efforts to confront its dark past, Posner shows the appalling depths to which ordinary men descend when they are unrestrained by conscience or any sense of morality.

Many of the earliest children's books, particularly those dating back to the 1850s and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive. Pook Press are working to republish these classic works in affordable, high quality, colour editions, using the original text and artwork so these works can delight another generation of children.

Peter Pan or, The Boy Who Would Not Grow Up was first performed in 1904 and published 24 years later; his only play intended explicitly for a young audience. Barrie's success as a playwright allowed him to indulge in a level of philanthropy and the royalties earned from the much adored Peter Pan have helped fund the Great Ormond Street Hospital since his death. About the Illustrator: Mabel Lucie Attwell (1879-1964) was a household name during the 1930s and 40s working mostly in watercolour and pen-and-ink.

Since then the incidence of child soldiers has proliferated in conflicts around the world: they are cheap, plentiful, expendable, with an incredible capacity, once drugged and brainwashed, for both loyalty and barbarism.\\nThe dilemma of the adult soldier who faces them is poignantly expressed in this book\\'s title: when children are shooting at you, they are soldiers, but as soon as they are wounded or killed, they are children once again. Believing that not one of us should tolerate a child being used in this fashion, Dallaire has made it his mission to end the use of child soldiers. Where Ishmael Beah\\'s A Long Way Gone gave us wrenching testimony of the devastating experience of being a child soldier, Dallaire offers intellectually daring and enlightened approaches to the child soldier phenomenon, and insightful, empowering solutions to eradicate it.'},\n",

Based in part on previously classified documents, Patricia Posner exposes Capesius's reign of terror at the camp, his escape from justice, fueled in part by his theft of gold ripped from the mouths of corpses, and how a handful of courageous survivors and a single brave prosecutor finally brought him to trial for murder twenty years after the end of the war.\\nThe Pharmacist of Auschwitzis much more, though, than a personal account of Capesius. It provides a spellbinding glimpse inside the devil's pact made between the Nazis and Germany's largest conglomerate, I.G. Farben, and its Bayer pharmaceutical subsidiary. The story is one of murder and greed with its roots in the dark heart of the Holocaust. It is told through Nazi henchmen and industrialists turned war criminals, intelligence agents and zealous prosecutors, and intrepid concentration camp survivors and Nazi hunters.\\nSet against a backdrop ranging from Hitler's war to conquer Europe to the Final Solution to postwar Germany's tormented efforts to confront its dark past, Posner shows the appalling depths to which ordinary men descend when they are unrestrained by conscience or any sense of morality. The Pharmacist of Auschwitzis a moving saga that lingers long after the final page.\"},\n",

Barrie's enduringly popular characters, Peter and Wendy, are immortalised by the delightful colour plates and black and white line drawings of Attwell's characteristically angelic children. Many of the earliest children's books, particularly those dating back to the 1850s and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive. Pook Press are working to republish these classic works in affordable, high quality, colour editions, using the original text and artwork so these works can delight another generation of children. About the Author: James M. Barrie (1860-1937) was a Scottish playwright and author who is best known for his character Peter Pan. Peter Pan or, The Boy Who Would Not Grow Up was first performed in 1904 and published 24 years later; his only play intended explicitly for a young audience. Barrie's success as a playwright allowed him to indulge in a level of philanthropy and the royalties earned from the much adored Peter Pan have helped fund the Great Ormond Street Hospital since his death. About the Illustrator: Mabel Lucie Attwell (1879-1964) was a household name during the 1930s and 40s working mostly in watercolour and pen-and-ink. The public was enthusiastic about her delicate early work and her illustrations of chubby, endearing toddlers were enormously popular, lending her much commercial success.\"},\n",

Since then the incidence of child soldiers has proliferated in conflicts around the world: they are cheap, plentiful, expendable, with an incredible capacity, once drugged and brainwashed, for both loyalty and barbarism.\\nThe dilemma of the adult soldier who faces them is poignantly expressed in this book\\'s title: when children are shooting at you, they are soldiers, but as soon as they are wounded or killed, they are children once again. Believing that not one of us should tolerate a child being used in this fashion, Dallaire has made it his mission to end the use of child soldiers. Where Ishmael Beah\\'s A Long Way Gone gave us wrenching testimony of the devastating experience of being a child soldier, Dallaire offers intellectually daring and enlightened approaches to the child soldier phenomenon, and insightful, empowering solutions to eradicate it.'},\n",

       "  'description': \"The Ego and the Idranks high among the works of Freud's later years. The heart of his concern is the ego, which he sees battling with three forces: the id, the super-ego, and the outside world.\\nOf the various English translations of Freud's major works to appear in his lifetime, only one was authorized by Freud himself: The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freudunder the general editorship of James Strachey.\\nFreud approved the overall editorial plan, specific renderings of key words and phrases, and the addition of valuable notes, from bibliographical and explanatory. Many of the translations were done by Strachey himself; the rest were prepared under his supervision. The result was to place the Standard Editionin a position of unquestioned supremacy over all other existing versions.\"},\n",

What possible purpose could a jerk of an ex-boyfriend serve in the grand scheme of things? After writing a ton of poetry chronicling her entire relationship (including some poems riddled with humor, and others filled to the brim with the highest levels of passivity), the whole reflection culminated in an unexpected life lesson that surfaced on 9/11. So it seems that even crappy ex-boyfriends are good for something after all.\"}]"
