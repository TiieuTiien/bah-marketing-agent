# ðŸ“Š Evaluation Plan for Multi-Agent Book Review System

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To systematically evaluate a multi-agent system that generates book reviews, ensuring outputs are **relevant, faithful, coherent, insightful, and efficient** while remaining transparent and reproducible.

---

## 1. Data Setup
- **Reference Dataset:** Goodreads Book Reviews (human-written). Stored in a database.
- **Evaluation Inputs:** Fixed set of books with consistent metadata and reference reviews.
- **Candidate Outputs:** Reviews generated by the multi-agent system.

---

## 2. Evaluation Layers

### A. Computation-Based Metrics (Reference-Dependent)
- **BLEU**: N-gram overlap with reference reviews.
- **ROUGE-L**: Longest common subsequence with reference reviews.
- **Embedding Similarity (Cosine)**: Semantic similarity between generated review and reference.

ðŸ‘‰ Purpose: Provides baseline quantitative alignment with human-written reviews.

---

### B. Model-Based Metrics (LLM-as-Judge, Reference-Optional)
Use a **judge model** (different from the generator if possible) with system instructions:
> *"You are a literary critic evaluating book reviews for relevance, faithfulness, coherence, and helpfulness."*

#### Pointwise Metrics (per review)
- **Relevance (0â€“5):** How focused is the review on the book content?
- **Faithfulness (0â€“5):** Does the review align with provided book data and avoid hallucinations?
- **Coherence (0â€“5):** Is the review well-structured, readable, and logically flowing?
- **Helpfulness/Insightfulness (0â€“5):** Does it provide meaningful critique beyond generic comments?

#### Pairwise Metrics (optional, A/B testing)
- Compare reviews from two system versions.
- Metrics: Preference (A vs B) for relevance, faithfulness, coherence.
- **Response flipping**: Randomize A/B order to reduce bias.

---

### C. System/Performance Metrics
- **Latency (mean/std):** Average time to generate a review.
- **Failure Rate:** % of empty/error outputs.
- **Trajectory Accuracy (if agentic steps matter):** % of correct intermediate steps/actions.

---

## 3. Evaluation Methodology
1. **Generate Candidate Reviews** using the multi-agent system for a fixed set of books.
2. **Run Computation-Based Metrics** comparing outputs to Goodreads references.
3. **Run Model-Based Evaluation**:
   - Use judge model with consistent instructions.
   - Multi-sample each review evaluation (e.g. 3x) and average scores.
   - For pairwise, use response flipping.
4. **Collect System Metrics** during generation (latency, failure, trajectory).

---

## 4. Reporting
- **Per-book report**: Metrics for each generated review.
- **Aggregate report**: Mean, std, min, max across all books.
- **Comparison runs**: Track metrics across system versions.

Example dashboard:
- **Quality Scores (LLM-judge):** Relevance, Faithfulness, Coherence, Helpfulness.
- **Overlap Metrics:** BLEU, ROUGE, Embedding similarity.
- **System Health:** Latency, Failures, Trajectory accuracy.

---

## 5. Transparency & Calibration
- Document whether references are human-written (Goodreads) or synthetic (LLM-generated).
- Calibrate judge model with small-scale **human evaluation** (e.g. 50 reviews) to check alignment.
- Clearly state when the same model is used for generation and judging (less transparent).

---

âœ… This plan ensures a **balanced evaluation**: computational baselines for objectivity, LLM-judging for subjective quality, and system metrics for operational health.
