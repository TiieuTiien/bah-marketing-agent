Based in part on previously classified documents, Patricia Posner exposes Capesius's reign of terror at the camp, his escape from justice, fueled in part by his theft of gold ripped from the mouths of corpses, and how a handful of courageous survivors and a single brave prosecutor finally brought him to trial for murder twenty years after the end of the war.\\nThe Pharmacist of Auschwitzis much more, though, than a personal account of Capesius. It provides a spellbinding glimpse inside the devil's pact made between the Nazis and Germany's largest conglomerate, I.G. Farben, and its Bayer pharmaceutical subsidiary. The story is one of murder and greed with its roots in the dark heart of the Holocaust. It is told through Nazi henchmen and industrialists turned war criminals, intelligence agents and zealous prosecutors, and intrepid concentration camp survivors and Nazi hunters.\\nSet against a backdrop ranging from Hitler's war to conquer Europe to the Final Solution to postwar Germany's tormented efforts to confront its dark past, Posner shows the appalling depths to which ordinary men descend when they are unrestrained by conscience or any sense of morality. The Pharmacist of Auschwitzis a moving saga that lingers long after the final page.\"},\n",

Barrie's enduringly popular characters, Peter and Wendy, are immortalised by the delightful colour plates and black and white line drawings of Attwell's characteristically angelic children. Many of the earliest children's books, particularly those dating back to the 1850s and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive. Pook Press are working to republish these classic works in affordable, high quality, colour editions, using the original text and artwork so these works can delight another generation of children. About the Author: James M. Barrie (1860-1937) was a Scottish playwright and author who is best known for his character Peter Pan. Peter Pan or, The Boy Who Would Not Grow Up was first performed in 1904 and published 24 years later; his only play intended explicitly for a young audience. Barrie's success as a playwright allowed him to indulge in a level of philanthropy and the royalties earned from the much adored Peter Pan have helped fund the Great Ormond Street Hospital since his death. About the Illustrator: Mabel Lucie Attwell (1879-1964) was a household name during the 1930s and 40s working mostly in watercolour and pen-and-ink. The public was enthusiastic about her delicate early work and her illustrations of chubby, endearing toddlers were enormously popular, lending her much commercial success.\"},\n",

Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores with rich humor and unswerving honesty the irrationality of adult attitudes toward race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence, and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina and quiet heroism of one man\\'s struggle for justice--but the weight of history will only tolerate so much.\\nOne of the best-loved classics of all time, To Kill a Mockingbirdhas earned many distinctions since its original publication in 1960. It won the Pulitzer Prize, has been translated into more than forty languages, sold more than forty million copies worldwide, and was been made into an enormously popular movie. It was also named the best novel of the twentieth century by librarians across the country (Library Journal). HarperCollins is proud to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the book\\'s publication with this special hardcover edition.'},\n",

The result is Persistence: All Ways Butch and Femme. The stories in these pages resist simple definitions. The people in these stories defy reductive stereotypes and inflexible categories. The pages in this book describe the lives of an incredible diversity of people whose hearts also pounded for some reason the first time they read or heard the words \"butch\" or \"femme.\"\\nContributors such as Jewelle Gomez (The Gilda Stories), Thea Hillman (Intersex), S.

Smith (Cumberland), and Zoe Whittall (Bottle Rocket Hearts) explore the parameters, history, and power of a multitude of butch and femme realities. It\\'s a raucous, insightful, sexy, and sometimes dangerous look at what the words butch and femme can mean in today\\'s ever-shifting gender landscape, with one eye on the past and the other on what is to come.\\nIncludes a foreword by Joan Nestle, renowned femme author and editor of The Persistent Desire: A Femme-Butch Reader, a landmark anthology originally published in 1992.\\nIvan E.

       "  'title': 'They Fight Like Soldiers, They Die Like Children: The Global Quest to Eradicate the Use of Child Soldiers',\n",
       "  'description': '\"It is my hope that through the pages of this remarkable book, you will discover groundbreaking thoughts on building partnerships and networks to enhance the global movement to end child soldiering; you will gain new and holistic insights on what constitutes a child soldier; you will learn more about girl soldiers, who have not been fully considered in the discussion of this issue; you will discover methods on how to influence national policies and the training of security forces; and you will find practical steps that will foster better coordination between security forces and humanitarian efforts.\"-Ishmael Beah \\nAs the leader of the ill-fated United Nations peacekeeping force in Rwanda, Lieutenant-General Romeo Dallaire came face-to-face with the horrifying reality of child soldiers during the genocide of 1994. Since then the incidence of child soldiers has proliferated in conflicts around the world: they are cheap, plentiful, expendable, with an incredible capacity, once drugged and brainwashed, for both loyalty and barbarism.\\nThe dilemma of the adult soldier who faces them is poignantly expressed in this book\\'s title: when children are shooting at you, they are soldiers, but as soon as they are wounded or killed, they are children once again. Believing that not one of us should tolerate a child being used in this fashion, Dallaire has made it his mission to end the use of child soldiers. Where Ishmael Beah\\'s A Long Way Gone gave us wrenching testimony of the devastating experience of being a child soldier, Dallaire offers intellectually daring and enlightened approaches to the child soldier phenomenon, and insightful, empowering solutions to eradicate it.'},\n",

       "  'description': \"The Ego and the Idranks high among the works of Freud's later years. The heart of his concern is the ego, which he sees battling with three forces: the id, the super-ego, and the outside world.\\nOf the various English translations of Freud's major works to appear in his lifetime, only one was authorized by Freud himself: The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freudunder the general editorship of James Strachey.\\nFreud approved the overall editorial plan, specific renderings of key words and phrases, and the addition of valuable notes, from bibliographical and explanatory. Many of the translations were done by Strachey himself; the rest were prepared under his supervision. The result was to place the Standard Editionin a position of unquestioned supremacy over all other existing versions.\"},\n",

       "  'description': \"Ok...So they say everything happens for a reason. But try telling that to a young woman with a newly broken heart. It doesn't help. What possible purpose could a jerk of an ex-boyfriend serve in the grand scheme of things? After writing a ton of poetry chronicling her entire relationship (including some poems riddled with humor, and others filled to the brim with the highest levels of passivity), the whole reflection culminated in an unexpected life lesson that surfaced on 9/11. So it seems that even crappy ex-boyfriends are good for something after all.\"}]"
