23209328,The Greatship,"Since the beginning of the universe, the giant starship wandered the emptiest reaches of space, without crew or course, much less any clear purpose. But humans found the relic outside the Milky Way, and after taking possession, they named their prize the Great Ship and embarked on a bold voyage through the galaxy's civilized hearts.
Larger than worlds, the Great Ship is laced with caverns and oceans, scenes of exalted beauty and corners where no creature has ever stood. Habitats can be created for every intelligent species, provided that the passengers can pay for the honor of a berth, and the human captains make the rules and dispense the justice in what soon becomes thousands of alien species joined a wild, unpredictable journey.
The first Great Ship story was ""The Remoras"", published in 1994 by THE MAGAZINE OF FANTASY AND SCIENCE FICTION. All but the most recent titles in the series have been included in this volume, arranged in a rough chronological order, each story partly rewritten to capture the author's growing expertise in the starship. New material has been added to bridge the centuries, hopefully enriching the resident confusion.
Robert Reedis the author of a dozen science fiction novels, including two titles about the Great Ship: MARROW and THE WELL OF STARS, both from Tor Books. He has also published more than two hundred shorter works, winning a Hugo in 2007 for his novella, ""A Billion Eves"". Reed is a long-term resident of Lincoln, Nebraska.",eng

470378,Go Tell It on the Mountain,"First published in 1953 when James Baldwin was nearly 30, Go Tell It on the Mountainis a young man's novel, as tightly coiled as a new spring, yet tempered by a maturing man's confidence and empathy. It's not a long book, and its action spans but a single day--yet the author packs in enough emotion, detail, and intimate revelation to make his story feel like a mid-20th-century epic. Using as a frame the spiritual and moral awakening of 14-year-old John Grimes during a Saturday night service in a Harlem storefront church, Baldwin lays bare the secrets of a tormented black family during the depression. John's parents, praying beside him, both wrestle with the ghosts of their sinful pasts--Gabriel, a preacher of towering hypocrisy, fathered an illegitimate child during his first marriage down South and refused to recognize his doomed bastard son; Elizabeth fell in love with a charming, free-spirited young man, followed him to New York, became pregnant with his son, and lost him before she could reveal her condition. Baldwin lays down the terrible symmetries of these two blighted lives as the ironic context for John's dark night of the soul. When day dawns, John believes himself saved, but his creator makes it clear that this salvation arises as much from blindness as revelation: ""He was filled with a joy, a joy unspeakable, whose roots, though he would not trace them on this new day of his life, were nourished by the wellspring of a despair not yet discovered."" 
Though it was hailed at publication for its groundbreaking use of black idiom, what is most striking about Go Tell It on the Mountaintoday is its structure and its scope. In peeling back the layers of these damaged lives, Baldwin dramatizes the story of the great black migration from rural South to urban North. ""Behind them was the darkness,"" Baldwin writes of Gabriel and Elizabeth's lost generation, ""nothing but the darkness, and all around them destruction, and before them nothing but the fire--a bastard people, far from God, singing and crying in the wilderness!"" This is Baldwin's music--a music in which rhapsody is rooted anguish--and there is none finer in American literature. --David Laskin",eng

29439515,Mud Between Your Toes: A Rhodesian Farm,"Glimpse a life filled with contradictions, discoveries, and passion in Peter Wood's fascinating new memoir, Mud Between Your Toes: A Rhodesian Farm.
This is a powerful story about a teenage boy growing up during the Rhodesian Bush War.
Peter Wood is an African. He is white, but he also holds a Chinese passport. And he is also gay.
Growing up during the 1970s on his family's farm in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Peter was swiftly introduced to a harsh world in which friends and relatives were murdered in ambushes--and the line between blacks and whites was drawn in blood.
As travel bans and UN sanctions caused a deepening chasm between his country and the rest of the world, Peter struggled with his identity as a white Rhodesian and later in life, when living in London, he nurtured his skills as a photographer--and finally found the courage to come out as gay.
Now a twenty-year resident of Hong Kong and an official Chinese national, Peter is arguably the only white, gay, African man in China. But his wildly entertaining anecdotes delve much deeper than that superficial--yet admittedly fascinating--label. These stories, based largely on Peter's childhood diary entries, offer insight into the universal human experience: from tragedies and triumphs to catastrophes and, perhaps most importantly, joy.",eng

Many nones believe in God and even visit places of worship, but they do not identify with a specific faith or belong to a spiritual community. Corinna Nicolaou is a none, and in this layered narrative, she describes what it is like for her and thousands of others to live without religion or to be spiritual without committing to a specific faith.
Nicolaou also tours America's major traditional religions to see what, if anything, one might lack without God. She moves through Christianity's denominations, learning their tenets and worshiping alongside their followers. She travels to Los Angeles to immerse herself in Judaism, Berkeley to educate herself about Buddhism, and Dallas and Washington, D.C., to familiarize herself with Islam. These encounters prove the significant role religion still plays in modern life. They also exemplify the vibrant relationship between religion and American culture and the enduring value it provides to immigrants and outsiders. Though she remains a devout none, Nicolaou's experiences reveal points of contact between the religious and the unaffiliated, suggesting nones may be radically revising the practice of faith in contemporary times.",eng

647608,BFI Film Classics: The Big Lebowski,"Since its release nearly ten years ago, The Big Lebowskihas become a cult classic with a worldwide following, having survived the baffled reaction of many mainstream critics. Its fans tend to be fanatical, congregating at 'Lebowski Conventions' in bowling alleys across American and Britain, and even dressing up as characters from the film. Among the funniest films of the last twenty-five years, and one of the high-water marks of 1990s genre recycling and pastiche, The Big Lebowskiis also littered with playful and subversive references to film history, especially to Raymond Chandler's world of hardboiled detective classics and the world of film noir. The Big Lebowskiis the rarest kind of film, a comedy whose jokes become funnier with repetition. The same goes for its multitudinous jukebox-like references to other films, many of which open up vistas for intertextual interpretation. Underneath the film's breakneck pacing and foul-mouthed characters, a farcical collection of flakes, losers, and phonies, is a surprisingly humane account of what fools we mortals be. It is one of the oddest buddy films ever made, with extraordinary performances by Jeff Bridges and John Goodman. In this study, The Big Lebowskiis set into the context of 1990s Hollywood cinema, anatomised for its witty relationship with the classics which it satirises, and discussed in terms of its key theme: the hopeless flailing of ridiculously unmanly men in the world of discombobulated, mixed-up, or put-on identities that is Los Angeles.",eng

16043432,The Yips,"The Man Booker Prize-nominated novel by one of the most original authors of our time
Storm clouds are gathering above the bar of the less-than-exclusive Thistle Hotel. Stuart Ransom, a jet-setting, supermodel-chasing pro golfer with an extravagant ego and a career nearing the end of a spectacular decline, is drinking his way through the night. Desperate for attention, he strikes up free-flowing conversations with anyone who will listen. But as he banters with Jen, the impish barmaid with a talent for telling tall tales rivaled only by Stuart's own, the night takes an extraordinary turn. Among those caught up in the unfolding drama are a tattooist with a mad mother and a love of anything from the 1940s; a free-thinking Muslim sex therapist and his considerably more conservative wife; the mysterious Vicki, the sister of Stuart's defiant yet curiously devoted manager; and a misguided female vicar of the Church of England and her husband, Gene, the Thistle's hapless bartender. They are a highly entertaining and eccentric bunch, but there's more to them than meets the eye. ""There enter in questions of what it is to be consumed by love or lust, by shame, by the longing to be someone else or nobody"" (The Guardian), and The Yipsunites them in an absorbing, exhilarating tour de force.",eng

In this groundbreaking book, Schmidt and Cohen combine observation and insight to outline the promise and peril awaiting us in the coming decades. At once pragmatic and inspirational, this is a forward-thinking account of where our world is headed and what this means for people, states and businesses.

23884508,Peter Pan and Wendy,"J. M. Barrie's enduringly popular characters, Peter and Wendy, are immortalised by the delightful colour plates and black and white line drawings of Attwell's characteristically angelic children. Many of the earliest children's books, particularly those dating back to the 1850s and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive. Pook Press are working to republish these classic works in affordable, high quality, colour editions, using the original text and artwork so these works can delight another generation of children. About the Author: James M. Barrie (1860-1937) was a Scottish playwright and author who is best known for his character Peter Pan. Peter Pan or, The Boy Who Would Not Grow Up was first performed in 1904 and published 24 years later; his only play intended explicitly for a young audience. Barrie's success as a playwright allowed him to indulge in a level of philanthropy and the royalties earned from the much adored Peter Pan have helped fund the Great Ormond Street Hospital since his death. About the Illustrator: Mabel Lucie Attwell (1879-1964) was a household name during the 1930s and 40s working mostly in watercolour and pen-and-ink. The public was enthusiastic about her delicate early work and her illustrations of chubby, endearing toddlers were enormously popular, lending her much commercial success.",eng

Excerpt from Miss Management Book 2: Shift Change from Manager to Waitress
2nd Edition: Significantly revised to meet Amazon standards
By Mindi Harris Copyright (c) 2015. All rights reserved.
It was 10 a.m. on a Wednesday morning. Private investigator Julie Swanson pushed the button to start her Prius. She was wearing a smart navy blue skirt suit, and brushing her long, brown hair out of her deep blue eyes. A youthful 28--she appeared to be about 21--she looked over at the light blue Jetta a few feet away on the driveway beside her. Inside the little VW sat three sexy feminine creatures. One of them, Mitch Kemp, was actually a man.
Julie giggled noting that he looked like the typical Tata Girl, and that ""she"" seemed to be in total shock. The other two lovely girls smiled back at Julie, but Mitch, alone in the back seat, stared vacantly into the middle distance. That was hardly a surprise as he'd been forcibly feminized earlier that morning.
""I wonder what Mitch is thinking,"" Julie pondered, ""the little thong he's wearing has to feel weird underneath his tight little uniform. And that push up bra squeezing his new C cup boobs can't be too comfortable. At least his thong matches his pink jogging suit,"" she laughed, recalling every detail of Mitch's humiliating transformation.
As a private eye, it was Julie's job to notice everything, and she'd noticed some very interesting things about Mitch. She reviewed her findings as she waved at Candy Jeffries and Lena Thomas, the two Tata Girls who'd done Mitch's hair and makeup, and dressed him as a sexy girl. Julie blew a kiss at Mitch and slowly pulled out of the driveway.
Suddenly, Julie heard a commotion behind her. Candy was honking the horn, and Mitch was squeezing out the car window. Julie slammed on the breaks as Mitch hit the driveway and started to run. He didn't get out of his front yard before Julie tackled him. She held him as Candy and Lena joined them.
Julie slapped Mitch across the face, just hard enough to startle, but not hard enough to smear his makeup. ""Listen you stupid bimbo,"" she said, ""you will be a perfect little Tata Girl, and you will do everything we say, or else!""
Lena and Candy put their hands over their mouths to stifle their shocked giggles while Julie showed Mitch dozens of pictures of his transformation on her phone....
""Now are you going to be a good girl?"" Julie asked.
Mitch nodded slightly, but Julie wasn't satisfied. ""We need you to say it, girl,"" she demanded, taking an aggressive stance with her arms folded tightly.
""Yes,"" Mitch said.
""Yes what?"" she prompted.
""Yes, I'll be a good...a good g-girl,"" Mitch stuttered.
""And what's your name?"" Julie asked.
""Mmmkay..."" Mitch mumbled.
""What was that?"" Julie asked.
""Mikayla, my name is Mikayla,"" Mitch said, almost gasping.

6064179,In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto,"""What to eat, what not to eat, and how to think about health: a manifesto for our times 'Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."" These simple words go to the heart of Michael Pollan's In Defense of Food, the well-considered answers he provides to the questions posed in the bestselling The Omnivore's Dilemma. Humans used to know how to eat well, Pollan argues. But the balanced dietary lessons that were once passed down through generations have been confused, complicated, and distorted by food industry marketers, nutritional scientists, and journalists--all of whom have much to gain from our dietary confusion. As a result, we face today a complex culinary landscape dense with bad advice and foods that are not ""real."" These ""edible foodlike substances"" are often packaged with labels bearing health claims that are typically false or misleading. Indeed, real food is fast disappearing from the marketplace, to be replaced by ""nutrients,"" and plain old eating by an obsession with nutrition that is, paradoxically, ruining our health, not to mention our meals. Michael Pollan's sensible and decidedly counterintuitive advice is: ""Don't eat anything that your great-great grandmother would not recognize as food."" Writing In Defense of Food, and affirming the joy of eating, Pollan suggests that if we would pay more for better, well-grown food, but buy less of it, we'll benefit ourselves, our communities, and the environment at large. Taking a clear-eyed look at what science does and does not know about the links between diet and health, he proposes a new way to think about the question of what to eat that is informed by ecology and tradition rather than by the prevailing nutrient-by-nutrient approach. In Defense of Foodreminds us that, despite the daunting dietary landscape Americans confront in the modern supermarket, the solutions to the current omnivore's dilemma can be found all around us. In looking toward traditional diets the world over, as well as the foods our families--and regions--historically enjoyed, we can recover a more balanced, reasonable, and pleasurable approach to food. Michael Pollan's bracing and eloquent manifesto shows us how we might start making thoughtful food choices that will enrich our lives and enlarge our sense of what it means to be healthy.",eng

Avery Steele moved back home just as she was getting dumped by her longtime boyfriend. His moving truck passed her with him in the cab right as Larry was telling her that he wanted to remain friends. She'd been crazy about him when she was in school, and seeing him now, all those silly feelings come back. What's a girl have to do to get his attention, though?

Alone and fighting the urge to sleep his way to a happier time, he can't see Maggie as anything other than a kid. She was four years younger than him in school and was one of his best friend's little sisters. He has too much on his plate to worry about hurting her feelings if she is the one he gets drunk with and takes to bed. It's best to avoid her, even if he finds her sexy as hell and all grown up.
Maggie had gone to a college over seven hundred miles away for a reason. At home, in Martinsville, she is Jay's little sister, or Kevin's baby girl.

She's waited long enough to get Avery's attention. It is time to get dirty. Wet T-shirt contests, mud wrestling competitions, and even a mechanical bull. Maggie is going to prove to Avery that she's not some little girl. She's a woman and she can make him one very happy man.

Lish's collection Breath makes the reader pause and reconsider his or her own world. The poems are sharp swords wrapped in velvet. - Ian McBryde
'Breath' is a unique, striking collection of poems by one of Melbourne's most loved poets, Elizabeth 'Lish' Skec. Here is a window into a world both real and magical, intimate and universal; a personal poetic journey at times funny, cheeky, political and yet at other times incredibly moving. Musical, accessible and strongly imagistic, 'Breath' taps into the soaring beauty of the everyday. This is an absolute gem of a book! - Amanda Anastasi
Lish Skec... a voice that is strong... earthy... real... she knows things... understands... seemingly instinctively... tells you things... and conveys that with a deceptive effortlessness... She shows an underlying depth in a clear and simple - but certainly not simplistic - voice that is singular and unique... a voice that is Hers! - Lee Fuhler
'mum's breast' is narrative poetry at its most crisp and powerful. The colloquial vernacular Lish employs masks the understated eloquence of a poet at the top of her game. This work is a personal journey traversing the breast cancer experience of a loved one, made universal through the warmth, humour, baldness, boldness and hope of the writing. I recommend 'mum's breast' to anyone who has ever undergone a serious health challenge, or sought to support anyone facing one. - Melissa Petrakis",eng

As the leader of the ill-fated United Nations peacekeeping force in Rwanda, Lieutenant-General Romeo Dallaire came face-to-face with the horrifying reality of child soldiers during the genocide of 1994. Since then the incidence of child soldiers has proliferated in conflicts around the world: they are cheap, plentiful, expendable, with an incredible capacity, once drugged and brainwashed, for both loyalty and barbarism.
The dilemma of the adult soldier who faces them is poignantly expressed in this book's title: when children are shooting at you, they are soldiers, but as soon as they are wounded or killed, they are children once again. Believing that not one of us should tolerate a child being used in this fashion, Dallaire has made it his mission to end the use of child soldiers. Where Ishmael Beah's A Long Way Gone gave us wrenching testimony of the devastating experience of being a child soldier, Dallaire offers intellectually daring and enlightened approaches to the child soldier phenomenon, and insightful, empowering solutions to eradicate it.",eng

With only a tenuous hold on her new gorgon abilities and with some of those monsters--the Kin--trying to kill her, Morgan's best bet is to move in with the mysterious Alexander Gage and his Kin team. Except she doesn't know if she can trust him, or herself for that matter when he's around. But when a young Kin woman is murdered with magic, Morgan must put aside her fear of her powers and face something more dangerous than just monsters: her emotions.
CASE #3: ESCAPED FROM STONE
Sometimes the monster in the dark is real.
Still trying to figure out her place in a world where the monsters of myth are real, U.S. Marshal Morgan Jacobs finally has a reprise from the madness. A murderer has escaped from jail, and while he is Kin--one of the monsters--Morgan at least knows how to handle a fugitive hunt. And with her best friend and fellow Marshal Kate helping out, it feels like nothing has changed. But everything has changed. Chasing a real monster is much more dangerous than chasing a human one and ignoring the truth could be deadly.",eng

33127119,The Pharmacist of Auschwitz: The Untold Story,"The Pharmacist of Auschwitzis the little known story of Victor Capesius, a Bayer pharmaceutical salesman from Romania who, at the age of 35, joined the Nazi SS in 1943 and quickly became the chief pharmacist at the largest death camp, Auschwitz. Based in part on previously classified documents, Patricia Posner exposes Capesius's reign of terror at the camp, his escape from justice, fueled in part by his theft of gold ripped from the mouths of corpses, and how a handful of courageous survivors and a single brave prosecutor finally brought him to trial for murder twenty years after the end of the war.
The Pharmacist of Auschwitzis much more, though, than a personal account of Capesius. It provides a spellbinding glimpse inside the devil's pact made between the Nazis and Germany's largest conglomerate, I.G. Farben, and its Bayer pharmaceutical subsidiary. The story is one of murder and greed with its roots in the dark heart of the Holocaust. It is told through Nazi henchmen and industrialists turned war criminals, intelligence agents and zealous prosecutors, and intrepid concentration camp survivors and Nazi hunters.
Set against a backdrop ranging from Hitler's war to conquer Europe to the Final Solution to postwar Germany's tormented efforts to confront its dark past, Posner shows the appalling depths to which ordinary men descend when they are unrestrained by conscience or any sense of morality. The Pharmacist of Auschwitzis a moving saga that lingers long after the final page.",eng

If the topic about African cuisine mystifies you, you would not be alone. Africa is arguably the world's most diverse region. It is an entire continent with 55 recognised independent states. When it comes to the food, you would be right to assume that there is more to it than meets the eye. is there such thing as African cuisine?
Africa has got a mixture of indigenous foods, with European, Asian and Middle Eastern influences depending on what region you venture into.
This can at times make it very difficult to distinguish between indigenous foods and those that have heavy external influences.
At the same time, by recognising the culinary signatures of the cuisines of particular African regions, we are able to trace the outward influence African cuisine has had on other cultures and vice versa, for example the links between West African and South American foods, or evenCaribbean food.
There used to be no real ""African Chefs"" because much of the knowledge of African cuisine has not been formalised or viewed in a professional light. Things are changing fast now and some African chefs are emerging. African cuisine is also vastly distinctive from region to region, therefore pairing different types of African cuisines can prove to be tricky.
This short book was designed as an introduction for beginners to the rich and blended culinary traditions from various african countries.

17918503,Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation,"Fire, water, air, earth--our most trusted food expert recounts the story of his culinary education
In Cooked, Michael Pollan explores the previously uncharted territory of his own kitchen. Here, he discovers the enduring power of the four classical elements--fire, water, air, and earth--to transform the stuff of nature into delicious things to eat and drink. Apprenticing himself to a succession of culinary masters, Pollan learns how to grill with fire, cook with liquid, bake bread, and ferment everything from cheese to beer. In the course of his journey, he discovers that the cook occupies a special place in the world, standing squarely between nature and culture. Both realms are transformed by cooking, and so, in the process, is the cook.
Each section of Cookedtracks Pollan's effort to master a single classic recipe using one of the four elements. A North Carolina barbecue pit master tutors him in the primal magic of fire; a Chez Panisse-trained cook schools him in the art of braising; a celebrated baker teaches him how air transforms grain and water into a fragrant loaf of bread; and finally, several mad-genius ""fermentos"" (a tribe that includes brewers, cheese makers, and all kinds of picklers) reveal how fungi and bacteria can perform the most amazing alchemies of all. The reader learns alongside Pollan, but the lessons move beyond the practical to become an investigation of how cooking involves us in a web of social and ecological relationships: with plants and animals, the soil, farmers, our history and culture, and, of course, the people our cooking nourishes and delights. Cooking, above all, connects us.
The effects of not cooking are similarly far reaching. Relying upon corporations to process our food means we consume huge quantities of fat, sugar, and salt; disrupt an essential link to the natural world; and weaken our relationships with family and friends. In fact, Cookedargues, taking back control of cooking may be the single most important step anyone can take to help make the American food system healthier and more sustainable. Reclaiming cooking as an act of enjoyment and self-reliance, learning to perform the magic of these everyday transformations, opens the door to a more nourishing life.",eng

Dagus recognised the red eyed woman as a dakaran immediately she walked into the slave pens on Garia where he was about to be sold. What was even more surprising was that she apparently had a voice in her head that told her that his friend Chesara was her sister.
But this was a very different animal to the kind and caring woman that'd saved his life. This sister was a cold, calculating killer of many sentient beings, both human and garian. Unfortunately she was also his only possible way off Garia, if he could persuade her that he was worth keeping alive.
His mentor Tenset had taught him how to charm the ladies, and how to rely on your friends. The problem was, this was no lady, and his friend had no idea where Dagus was, or even that he was in trouble.",eng

9475378,Persistence: All Ways Butch and Femme,"Lambda Literary Award finalist
American Library Association Stonewall Honor Book
In the summer of 2009, butch writer and storyteller Ivan Coyote and gender researcher and femme dynamo Zena Sharman wrote down a wish-list of their favourite queer authors; they wanted to continue and expand the butch-femme conversation. The result is Persistence: All Ways Butch and Femme. The stories in these pages resist simple definitions. The people in these stories defy reductive stereotypes and inflexible categories. The pages in this book describe the lives of an incredible diversity of people whose hearts also pounded for some reason the first time they read or heard the words ""butch"" or ""femme.""
Contributors such as Jewelle Gomez (The Gilda Stories), Thea Hillman (Intersex), S. Bear Bergman (Butch is a Noun), Chandra Mayor (All the Pretty Girls), Amber Dawn (Sub Rosa), Anna Camilleri (Brazen Femme), Debra Anderson (Code White), Anne Fleming (Anomaly), Michael V. Smith (Cumberland), and Zoe Whittall (Bottle Rocket Hearts) explore the parameters, history, and power of a multitude of butch and femme realities. It's a raucous, insightful, sexy, and sometimes dangerous look at what the words butch and femme can mean in today's ever-shifting gender landscape, with one eye on the past and the other on what is to come.
Includes a foreword by Joan Nestle, renowned femme author and editor of The Persistent Desire: A Femme-Butch Reader, a landmark anthology originally published in 1992.
Ivan E. Coyoteis the author of seven books (including the novel Bow Grip, an American Library Association Stonewall Honor Book) and a long-time muser on the trappings of the two-party gender system.

But it's hardly surprising considering how long it's had to hone its skills. Forty-thousand years ago, our ancestors set off from the cradle of civilization on their journey towards populating the planet. Tuberculosis hitched a lift and came with us, and it's been there ever since; waiting, watching, and learning.
The organism responsible, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, has had plenty of time to adapt to its chosen habitat--human lungs--and has learned through natural selection to be an almost perfect pathogen. Using our own immune cells as a Trojan Horse to aid its spread, it's come up with clever ways to avoid being killed by antibiotics. But patience has been its biggest lesson--it can enter into a latent state when times are tough, only to come back to life when a host's immune system is compromised. Today, more than one million people die of the disease every year and around one-third of the world's population are believed to be infected. That's more than two billion people. Throw in the compounding problems of drug resistance, the HIV epidemic, and poverty, and it's clear that tuberculosis remains one of the most serious problems in world medicine.
Catching Breathfollows the history of TB through the ages, from its time as an infection of hunter-gatherers to the first human villages, which set it up with everything it needed to become the monstrous disease it is today, through to the perils of industrialization and urbanization.

1074682,Chowringhee,"'Here, day and night were interchangeable. The immaculately dressed Chowringhee, radiant in her youth, had just stepped on to the floor at the nightclub.' Set in 1950s Calcutta, Chowringhee is a sprawling saga of the intimate lives of managers, employees and guests at one of Calcutta's largest hotels, the Shahjahan. Shankar, the newest recruit, recounts the stories of several people whose lives come together in the suites, restaurants, bar and backrooms of the hotel. As both observer and participant in the events, he inadvertently peels off the layers of everyday existence to expose the seamy underbelly of unfulfilled desires, broken dreams, callous manipulation and unbidden tragedy. What unfolds is not just the story of individual lives but also the incredible chronicle of a metropolis. Written by best-selling Bengali author Sankar, Chowringhee was published as a novel in 1962. Predating Arthur Hailey's Hotel by three years, it became an instant hit, spawning translations in major Indian languages, a film and a play. Its larger-than-life characters--the enigmatic manager Marco Polo, the debonair receptionist Sata Bose, the tragic hostess Karabi Guha, among others--soon attained cult status. With its thinly veiled accounts of the private lives of real-life celebrities, and its sympathetic narrative seamlessly weaving the past and the present, it immediately established itself as a popular classic. Available for the first time in English, Chowringhee is as much a dirge as it is a homage to a city and its people.

23553382,The Virtues of Imam Abu Hanifa and His Two Companions Abu Yusuf and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan,"Al-Imam al-A'zam Abu Hanifa, may Allah be pleased with him, was the founder of the Hanafi madhhab (School of Jurisprudence) that bears his name, which was given its fullest expression by his 'Two Companions,' Imam Abu Yusuf and Imam Muhammad ibn al-Hasan. It is the largest of the four madhhabs and is most extensive in the East, but with a sizeable presence in Europe and the West with the presence of immigrant Turkish and Pakistani Muslim communities.
Imam Abu Hanifa's systematization of Islamic legal doctrine was to have an integral part in the development of many areas of the Shari'ah and would pave the way for the spread of Islam in many parts of the world resulting most notably in the Ottoman Empire and Mughal rule in the Indian sub-continent.
With the onslaught of colonialism over the last few centuries, and with Muslim rule in general decline; events were further exacerbated when the rebellious Wahhabi tribes of the Najd joined with the British agent T.E.Lawrence to disrupt Ottoman supplies to their army. This resulted in defeat for the Ottomans and for his part Ibn Saud was not only knighted but also made a king. The land known simply as Arabia during the Prophet's, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, life and for over thirteen centuries thereafter, became - courtesy of the British - 'Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.'
Criticism of the Hanafi school is nothing new but the hostility towards the School in recent times (particularly through the internet in English) has increased to such an extent that lies are now being peddled questioning the basis of the School whilst also making spurious baseless accusations against the founder. We hope the translation of this work by Imam al-Dhahabi who was not only an outstanding hadith scholar (and not a Hanafi - he was a follower of the Shafi'i School) but also a student of Ibn Taymiyya, who many of the critics of Imam Abu Hanifa hold in high regard.",eng

Taking in 440 sextillion kilometres of space and 13.8 billion years of time, it is physically impossible to make a better map: we will never see the early Universe in more detail. On the one hand, such a view is the apotheosis of modern cosmology, on the other, it threatens to undermine almost everything we hold cosmologically sacrosanct.
The map contains anomalies that challenge our understanding of the Universe. It will force us to revisit what is known and what is unknown, to construct a new model of our Universe. This is the first book to address what will be an epoch-defining scientific paradigm shift. Stuart Clark will ask if Newton's famous laws of gravity need to be rewritten, if dark matter and dark energy are just celestial phantoms? Can we ever know what happened before the Big Bang?

But the moment convicted murderer Ricky Langley's face flashes on the screen as she reviews old tapes--the moment she hears him speak of his crimes--she is overcome with the feeling of wanting him to die. Shocked by her reaction, she digs deeper and deeper into the case. Despite their vastly different circumstances, something in his story is unsettlingly, uncannily familiar.
Crime, even the darkest and most unsayable acts, can happen to any one of us. As Alexandria pores over the facts of the murder, she finds herself thrust into the complicated narrative of Ricky's childhood. And by examining the details of Ricky's case, she is forced to face her own story, to unearth long-buried family secrets, and reckon with a past that colors her view of Ricky's crime.

An intellectual and emotional thriller that is also a different kind of murder mystery, THE FACT OF A BODY is a book not only about how the story of one crime was constructed--but about how we grapple with our own personal histories. Along the way it tackles questions about the nature of forgiveness, and if a single narrative can ever really contain something as definitive as the truth.

And while Josh's great deeds and mission of peace will ultimately change the world, Biff is no slouch himself, blessing humanity with enduring contributions of his own, like sarcasm and cafe latte.

35013272,The First Men in the Moon,"The First Men in the Moon is a 1901 scientific romance novel by the British author H. G. Wells. The novel tells the story of a journey to the moon undertaken by the two main protagonists, the impecunious businessman Mr Bedford and the brilliant but eccentric scientist Dr Cavor. On arrival, Bedford and Cavor find the moon inhabited by an extra terrestrial civilization the two name as ""Selenites.""
The novel can also be read as a critique of prevailing political opinions of the period, particularly of imperialism. The theme of a clash between civilizations is reminiscent of Wells' earlier and more famous work, The War of the Worlds. As in The War of the Worlds, it is hinted that the non-human civilization presented might reflect the way human society would develop in the far future. As such, the Selenite society depicted could be considered either a utopia or a dystopia, depending on which of its features one emphasizes.
