If the topic about African cuisine mystifies you, you would not be alone. Africa is arguably the world's most diverse region. It is an entire continent with 55 recognised independent states. When it comes to the food, you would be right to assume that there is more to it than meets the eye. is there such thing as African cuisine?
Africa has got a mixture of indigenous foods, with European, Asian and Middle Eastern influences depending on what region you venture into.
This can at times make it very difficult to distinguish between indigenous foods and those that have heavy external influences.
At the same time, by recognising the culinary signatures of the cuisines of particular African regions, we are able to trace the outward influence African cuisine has had on other cultures and vice versa, for example the links between West African and South American foods, or evenCaribbean food.
There used to be no real ""African Chefs"" because much of the knowledge of African cuisine has not been formalised or viewed in a professional light. Things are changing fast now and some African chefs are emerging. African cuisine is also vastly distinctive from region to region, therefore pairing different types of African cuisines can prove to be tricky.
This short book was designed as an introduction for beginners to the rich and blended culinary traditions from various african countries.

2,The Collected Poems of Dylan Thomas,"The Collected Poems of Dylan Thomascontains poems that Thomas personally decided best represented his work. A year before its publication Thomas died from swelling of the brain triggered by excessive drinking.

Thomas wrote ""Prologue"" addressed to ""my readers, the strangers"" -- an introduction in verse that was the last poem he would ever write. Also included are classics such as ""And Death Shall Have No Dominion,"" ""Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night,"" and ""Fern Hill"" that have influenced generations of artists from Bob Dylan (who changed his last name from Zimmerman in honor of the poet), to John Lennon (The Beatles included Thomas' portrait on the cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band); this collection even appears in the film adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's The Roadwhen it is retrieved from the rubble of a bookshelf.","Viết bài đánh giá về ""The Collected Poems of Dylan Thomas"" tập trung vào cách thơ ca của ông khám phá sự giằng xé giữa khao khát sự bất tử và chấp nhận sự hữu hạn của cuộc sống, đặc biệt khi nhìn vào bối cảnh cái chết sớm của nhà thơ."

The child of two lawyers, she is staunchly anti-death penalty. But the moment convicted murderer Ricky Langley's face flashes on the screen as she reviews old tapes--the moment she hears him speak of his crimes--she is overcome with the feeling of wanting him to die. Shocked by her reaction, she digs deeper and deeper into the case. Despite their vastly different circumstances, something in his story is unsettlingly, uncannily familiar.
Crime, even the darkest and most unsayable acts, can happen to any one of us. As Alexandria pores over the facts of the murder, she finds herself thrust into the complicated narrative of Ricky's childhood. And by examining the details of Ricky's case, she is forced to face her own story, to unearth long-buried family secrets, and reckon with a past that colors her view of Ricky's crime.

This is a powerful story about a teenage boy growing up during the Rhodesian Bush War.
Peter Wood is an African. He is white, but he also holds a Chinese passport. And he is also gay.
Growing up during the 1970s on his family's farm in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Peter was swiftly introduced to a harsh world in which friends and relatives were murdered in ambushes--and the line between blacks and whites was drawn in blood.
As travel bans and UN sanctions caused a deepening chasm between his country and the rest of the world, Peter struggled with his identity as a white Rhodesian and later in life, when living in London, he nurtured his skills as a photographer--and finally found the courage to come out as gay.
Now a twenty-year resident of Hong Kong and an official Chinese national, Peter is arguably the only white, gay, African man in China. But his wildly entertaining anecdotes delve much deeper than that superficial--yet admittedly fascinating--label. These stories, based largely on Peter's childhood diary entries, offer insight into the universal human experience: from tragedies and triumphs to catastrophes and, perhaps most importantly, joy.","Viết bài đánh giá về cuốn sách ""Mud Between Your Toes: A Rhodesian Farm"" tập trung vào cách tác giả khám phá và hòa giải các bản sắc mâu thuẫn của mình (người châu Phi da trắng, người Trung Quốc, người đồng tính) trong bối cảnh chính trị và xã hội đầy biến động của Rhodesia và thế giới."

30,The Pharmacist of Auschwitz: The Untold Story,"The Pharmacist of Auschwitzis the little known story of Victor Capesius, a Bayer pharmaceutical salesman from Romania who, at the age of 35, joined the Nazi SS in 1943 and quickly became the chief pharmacist at the largest death camp, Auschwitz. Based in part on previously classified documents, Patricia Posner exposes Capesius's reign of terror at the camp, his escape from justice, fueled in part by his theft of gold ripped from the mouths of corpses, and how a handful of courageous survivors and a single brave prosecutor finally brought him to trial for murder twenty years after the end of the war.
The Pharmacist of Auschwitzis much more, though, than a personal account of Capesius. It provides a spellbinding glimpse inside the devil's pact made between the Nazis and Germany's largest conglomerate, I.G. Farben, and its Bayer pharmaceutical subsidiary. The story is one of murder and greed with its roots in the dark heart of the Holocaust. It is told through Nazi henchmen and industrialists turned war criminals, intelligence agents and zealous prosecutors, and intrepid concentration camp survivors and Nazi hunters.
Set against a backdrop ranging from Hitler's war to conquer Europe to the Final Solution to postwar Germany's tormented efforts to confront its dark past, Posner shows the appalling depths to which ordinary men descend when they are unrestrained by conscience or any sense of morality. The Pharmacist of Auschwitzis a moving saga that lingers long after the final page.","Tôi muốn viết bài đánh giá về cuốn sách ""The Pharmacist of Auschwitz"" tập trung vào sự hợp tác tội ác giữa tập đoàn dược phẩm Bayer và chế độ Nazi, khai thác động cơ lợi nhuận đằng sau những hành động vô nhân đạo trong trại tập trung Auschwitz."

47,Peter Pan and Wendy,"J. M. Barrie's enduringly popular characters, Peter and Wendy, are immortalised by the delightful colour plates and black and white line drawings of Attwell's characteristically angelic children. Many of the earliest children's books, particularly those dating back to the 1850s and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive. Pook Press are working to republish these classic works in affordable, high quality, colour editions, using the original text and artwork so these works can delight another generation of children. About the Author: James M. Barrie (1860-1937) was a Scottish playwright and author who is best known for his character Peter Pan. Peter Pan or, The Boy Who Would Not Grow Up was first performed in 1904 and published 24 years later; his only play intended explicitly for a young audience. Barrie's success as a playwright allowed him to indulge in a level of philanthropy and the royalties earned from the much adored Peter Pan have helped fund the Great Ormond Street Hospital since his death. About the Illustrator: Mabel Lucie Attwell (1879-1964) was a household name during the 1930s and 40s working mostly in watercolour and pen-and-ink. The public was enthusiastic about her delicate early work and her illustrations of chubby, endearing toddlers were enormously popular, lending her much commercial success.","Viết bài đánh giá về ""Peter Pan và Wendy"" tập trung vào sự giằng xé giữa khao khát phiêu lưu và nỗi sợ trưởng thành, thể hiện qua nhân vật Peter Pan."

""Every one of these cartoons is just something that drifted into my head when I was alone with my thoughts. And, for better or worse, I 'jotted' them down. It was only later, when perhaps I received an angry letter from someone, that it struck me: Hey! Someone's been reading my diary!""
Gary Larson, from the preface to The Complete Far Side
Revered by its fans as the funniest, most original, most ""What the ... ?""-inspiring cartoon ever, The Far Side(r) debuted in January 1980 and enjoyed an illustrious 14 years on the worlds comics pages until Gary Larson's retirement in 1994.

his retirement: 13 that appeared in the last Far Side book,
Last Chapter and Worse, and six cartoons that periodically ran as a special feature in The New York Times Science Times section as The Far Side of Science.
Creator Gary Larson offers a rare glimpse into the mind of The Far Side(r)in quirky and thoughtful introductions to each of the 14 chapters. Complaint letters, fan letters, and queries from puzzled readers appear alongside some of the more provocative or elusive panels. Actor, author,and comedian Steve Martin offers his pithy thoughts in a foreword, and Gary
Larson's former editor describes what it was like to be ""the guy who could explain every Far Side cartoon.""

61,The First Men in the Moon,"The First Men in the Moon is a 1901 scientific romance novel by the British author H. G. Wells. The novel tells the story of a journey to the moon undertaken by the two main protagonists, the impecunious businessman Mr Bedford and the brilliant but eccentric scientist Dr Cavor. On arrival, Bedford and Cavor find the moon inhabited by an extra terrestrial civilization the two name as ""Selenites.""
The novel can also be read as a critique of prevailing political opinions of the period, particularly of imperialism. The theme of a clash between civilizations is reminiscent of Wells' earlier and more famous work, The War of the Worlds. As in The War of the Worlds, it is hinted that the non-human civilization presented might reflect the way human society would develop in the far future. As such, the Selenite society depicted could be considered either a utopia or a dystopia, depending on which of its features one emphasizes.
Berkley Highland Edition F1398","Tôi muốn viết bài đánh giá về cuốn ""The First Men in the Moon"" tập trung vào việc phân tích xã hội Selenite, làm rõ những yếu tố khiến nó vừa có thể coi là một xã hội утопиа, vừa có thể coi là một xã hội phản утопиа, và hàm ý phê phán xã hội loài người đương thời của H.G.

63,"Forty Nights (Neima's Ark, #2)","Neima, her family, and her grandfather Noah have found themselves trapped aboard an ark as a great flood destroys all life in the world.

In the second and final installment of Neima's Ark, the stakes are higher, the conflicts are greater, and Neima finds herself facing a choice as impossible as the destruction all around her.
Forty Nights is a continuation of the story begun in Forty Days, and it's recommended that you read Forty Days first for the best experience. Forty Nights does, however, contain a character guide to refresh readers' memories. The Neima's Ark series is a historical, feminist reimagining of the story of Noah's Ark rather than a religiously oriented one, and the novels are best suited for readers who are comfortable with new interpretations of biblical stories.

65,To Kill a Mockingbird,"""Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.""
A lawyer's advice to his children as he defends the real mockingbird of Harper Lee's classic novel--a black man charged with the rape of a white girl. Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores with rich humor and unswerving honesty the irrationality of adult attitudes toward race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence, and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina and quiet heroism of one man's struggle for justice--but the weight of history will only tolerate so much.
One of the best-loved classics of all time, To Kill a Mockingbirdhas earned many distinctions since its original publication in 1960. It won the Pulitzer Prize, has been translated into more than forty languages, sold more than forty million copies worldwide, and was been made into an enormously popular movie. It was also named the best novel of the twentieth century by librarians across the country (Library Journal). HarperCollins is proud to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the book's publication with this special hardcover edition.","Tôi muốn viết bài đánh giá về cuốn sách ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" tập trung vào cách sự trưởng thành của Scout và Jem Finch bị ảnh hưởng bởi những định kiến chủng tộc và sự bất công mà họ chứng kiến trong xã hội miền Nam những năm 1930."

68,Persistence: All Ways Butch and Femme,"Lambda Literary Award finalist
American Library Association Stonewall Honor Book
In the summer of 2009, butch writer and storyteller Ivan Coyote and gender researcher and femme dynamo Zena Sharman wrote down a wish-list of their favourite queer authors; they wanted to continue and expand the butch-femme conversation. The result is Persistence: All Ways Butch and Femme. The stories in these pages resist simple definitions. The people in these stories defy reductive stereotypes and inflexible categories. The pages in this book describe the lives of an incredible diversity of people whose hearts also pounded for some reason the first time they read or heard the words ""butch"" or ""femme.""
Contributors such as Jewelle Gomez (The Gilda Stories), Thea Hillman (Intersex), S. Bear Bergman (Butch is a Noun), Chandra Mayor (All the Pretty Girls), Amber Dawn (Sub Rosa), Anna Camilleri (Brazen Femme), Debra Anderson (Code White), Anne Fleming (Anomaly), Michael V. Smith (Cumberland), and Zoe Whittall (Bottle Rocket Hearts) explore the parameters, history, and power of a multitude of butch and femme realities. It's a raucous, insightful, sexy, and sometimes dangerous look at what the words butch and femme can mean in today's ever-shifting gender landscape, with one eye on the past and the other on what is to come.
Includes a foreword by Joan Nestle, renowned femme author and editor of The Persistent Desire: A Femme-Butch Reader, a landmark anthology originally published in 1992.
Ivan E. Coyoteis the author of seven books (including the novel Bow Grip, an American Library Association Stonewall Honor Book) and a long-time muser on the trappings of the two-party gender system.
Zena Sharmanis the assistant director of Canada's national Institute of Gender and Health.","Tôi muốn viết bài đánh giá về cuốn sách ""Persistence: All Ways Butch and Femme"" tập trung vào cách các tác giả phá vỡ những khuôn mẫu cứng nhắc về giới và thể hiện sự đa dạng trong trải nghiệm butch và femme, đặc biệt là sự giao thoa giữa bản sắc cá nhân và lịch sử cộng đồng."

Clinging to life, Seregil is sustained only by the hope that Alec is alive.
But it is not Alec's life his strange master wants--it is his blood. For his unique lineage is capable of producing a rare treasure, but only through a harrowing process that will test him body and soul and unwittingly entangle him and Seregil in the realm of alchemists and madmen--and an enigmatic creature that may hold their very destiny in its inhuman hands.... But will it prove to be savior or monster?","Đánh giá cuốn ""Shadows Return (Nightrunner, #4)"" tập trung vào sự giằng xé giữa lòng trung thành và sự tự do cá nhân mà Seregil và Alec phải đối mặt khi bị bán làm nô lệ và buộc phải lựa chọn giữa phục vụ chủ nhân mới hay tìm cách trốn thoát để bảo vệ nhau."
96,Forever Amber,"Abandoned pregnant and penniless on the teeming streets of London, 16-year-old Amber St. Clare manages, by using her wits, beauty, and courage, to climb to the highest position a woman could achieve in Restoration England--that of favorite mistress of the Merry Monarch, Charles II. From whores and highwaymen to courtiers and noblemen, from events such as the Great Plague and the Fire of London to the intimate passions of ordinary--and extraordinary--men and women, Amber experiences it all. But throughout her trials and escapades, she remains, in her heart, true to the one man she really loves, the one man she can never have.

98,"They Fight Like Soldiers, They Die Like Children: The Global Quest to Eradicate the Use of Child Soldiers","""It is my hope that through the pages of this remarkable book, you will discover groundbreaking thoughts on building partnerships and networks to enhance the global movement to end child soldiering; you will gain new and holistic insights on what constitutes a child soldier; you will learn more about girl soldiers, who have not been fully considered in the discussion of this issue; you will discover methods on how to influence national policies and the training of security forces; and you will find practical steps that will foster better coordination between security forces and humanitarian efforts.""-Ishmael Beah 
As the leader of the ill-fated United Nations peacekeeping force in Rwanda, Lieutenant-General Romeo Dallaire came face-to-face with the horrifying reality of child soldiers during the genocide of 1994. Since then the incidence of child soldiers has proliferated in conflicts around the world: they are cheap, plentiful, expendable, with an incredible capacity, once drugged and brainwashed, for both loyalty and barbarism.
The dilemma of the adult soldier who faces them is poignantly expressed in this book's title: when children are shooting at you, they are soldiers, but as soon as they are wounded or killed, they are children once again. Believing that not one of us should tolerate a child being used in this fashion, Dallaire has made it his mission to end the use of child soldiers. Where Ishmael Beah's A Long Way Gone gave us wrenching testimony of the devastating experience of being a child soldier, Dallaire offers intellectually daring and enlightened approaches to the child soldier phenomenon, and insightful, empowering solutions to eradicate it.","Tôi muốn viết bài đánh giá về cuốn sách ""They Fight Like Soldiers, They Die Like Children"" tập trung vào thách thức đạo đức và tâm lý mà người lính trưởng thành phải đối mặt khi đối đầu với những đứa trẻ bị biến thành công cụ chiến tranh, thể hiện qua sự giằng xé giữa việc nhìn nhận chúng như những người lính và những đứa trẻ vô tội."
99,The Ego and the Id,"The Ego and the Idranks high among the works of Freud's later years. The heart of his concern is the ego, which he sees battling with three forces: the id, the super-ego, and the outside world.
Of the various English translations of Freud's major works to appear in his lifetime, only one was authorized by Freud himself: The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freudunder the general editorship of James Strachey.
Freud approved the overall editorial plan, specific renderings of key words and phrases, and the addition of valuable notes, from bibliographical and explanatory. Many of the translations were done by Strachey himself; the rest were prepared under his supervision. The result was to place the Standard Editionin a position of unquestioned supremacy over all other existing versions.","Tôi muốn viết bài đánh giá về cuốn sách ""The Ego and the Id"" tập trung vào cuộc đấu tranh giữa bản năng (Id), lý trí (Ego) và lương tâm (Super-ego) trong việc hình thành nên nhân cách và hành vi con người."
100,His PhD Is in Hypocrisy: And Other Poems about My Crappy Ex-Boyfriend,"Ok...So they say everything happens for a reason. But try telling that to a young woman with a newly broken heart. It doesn't help. What possible purpose could a jerk of an ex-boyfriend serve in the grand scheme of things? After writing a ton of poetry chronicling her entire relationship (including some poems riddled with humor, and others filled to the brim with the highest levels of passivity), the whole reflection culminated in an unexpected life lesson that surfaced on 9/11. So it seems that even crappy ex-boyfriends are good for something after all.","Viết bài đánh giá về tập thơ ""His PhD Is in Hypocrisy"", tập trung vào cách tác giả sử dụng sự hài hước và châm biếm để đối phó với nỗi đau và rút ra bài học từ một mối quan hệ thất bại."
